## Why?
Github offers the possibility of see the repositories and developers that are more appealing for the community daily, weekly and monthly. Also you can filter them by selecting your preferred coding language. It’s pretty good for having an idea of what the community is most excited about.

However, I want to add some features. For example, the ability to know how much time the repo/dev is on the spot and its relative gains and looses positions during the permanency on the trending chart.

For those reasons and because I want to show some uses for [**zircle-ui**](https://github.com/zircleUI/zircleUI) is that I'm trying to present  an alternative approach.
